1) Not found for every path? So then if you do a POST request to /bla you'd get a JSON with {"error": "not found"} or something. Or maybe just block every random request like that too?
2) Register/Login EP testing once reach a certain level of active users
3) StatusUnauthorized everywhere where you're not logged in?
4) Use GET from url package instead of manually checking for length of parameters from URL

Tips:
When connecting to ws://address, need to be careful, because apparently even when I'm doing it from
https://www.websocket.org/echo.html, if I'm authenticated on the site, it will send the cookies attached to the request!?
